**Company Sales in Q1 2019**

This project demonstrates my proficiency in data analysis using Microsoft Excel. The objective was to analyze sales data for the first quarter of 2019 and derive meaningful insights. The following tasks were performed:

* **Data Cleaning and Aggregation:** The dataset consisted of 10,001 rows of sales data. I cleaned the data by removing duplicates and handling missing values. Then, I aggregated the data to gain a comprehensive view.
* **IF Function for Rating Category:** I utilized the IF function in Excel to add a "rating_category" column. This column categorizes the sales based on specific criteria.
* **Text-to-Columns:** I used the Text-to-Columns function in Excel to split the Date column into separate columns with the "MDY" format, using the delimiter "/".
* **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Various data analysis techniques were employed to uncover insights. This included creating pivot tables, graph charts, and a comprehensive dashboard.
* **Key Findings from Excel Dashboard Visualization:-**
 
     1. The **Food and Beverages** product category generated the highest sales, totaling $56k.
